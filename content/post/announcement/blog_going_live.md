Hello there! I'm Pandalazy, nice to meet you! Want to start with a bit about me but really not much to say really XD
Let's just say that I'm just a guy who wants to chase his dreams and make of something I like a way of living!


Blogging starts today! But, what I will be blogging about here? The general idea I have for this starting a blog
thing is to help me learn (and expect readers too)
So I will be publishing multi part tutorials and web design stuff (which is going to be one of the first topics here).

Other things that will be covered here in the future will be about Linux OS and game development, being the late a
personal goal! Still learning so will start with the most basic building blocks of what a game is.

Without more to say now, I'm looking forward to see you again on next post!

Thank you for reading!
